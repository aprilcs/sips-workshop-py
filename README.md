# Title
    The great candy swap experiment :)

# Description
    This replication archive contains all data and code to replicate our candy swap analyses. Every participant was given a random assortment of 6 or 7 candies. They were asked to rate the happiness of their selection on a scale from 1-10 (trade 0. They were then allowed to trade with one participant and rate their happiness with their selection (trade 1). They were then allowed to trade with the whole group and rate their happiness with their selection (trade 3). n=6
